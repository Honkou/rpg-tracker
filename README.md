# rpg-tracker
A simple .exe file for WFRP2ed to track player's data.

This a software written by me in middle school, therefore it's not very pretty. Its main purpose was to store players characters' attributes and provide a simple dice roller for the GM to roll behind the screen.

Since this is an AutoIT file, make sure to compile it before using it.
